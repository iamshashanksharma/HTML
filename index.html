    <!--HTML colors-->
    <h1 style="background-color:rgb(255,99,71)">This is rgb</h1>

    <h1 style="background-color: hsl(9, 100%, 64%);">This is hsl</h1>
    <h1 style="background-color:rgba(255,99,71,0.5);">This is rgba</h1>

    <h1 style="background-color:hsla(9,100%,64%,0.5)">This is hsla</h1>
    
    <h1 style="background-color: hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);"></h1>
    <!-- There are color values named like rgb , hex , hsl
    RGB - Red , Green , Blue
    -> in detail :- 
    each para(rgb defines the intensity of the color with value b/w 0 and 255
    ) . 
    -> then we can infer that there are 256*256*256 possible colors which is 16777216
    rgb(255,0,0) means red rgb(0,0,255) means blue rgb(0,255,0) means green,
    Then the question arise what is rgb(0,0,0) here we go it is black 
    rgb(255,255,255) whoa it is white

    Now how to achieve gray 
      rgb(100,100,100) , rgb(60,60,60) rgb(50,50,50)

      when we type values equal for all three parameters we get shades of grey

    Now the question arises what is rgba

    ok then rgba is extension of rgb with an alpha channel(which specifies the opacity of the color
    Now after googling i get to know what is opacity the degree at which the light cannot be transmitted or any opaque object means difficulty to see through 
    opossite of opacity means transparency
    
    so 0.0 means fully transparent, 1.0 means not transparent at all)
     example : - rgba(255,99,71,0.2)


     Now come to hex color values;
    hex: is hexadecimal value of rgb
     -- color can be specified in hex value 
     like #rrggbb where 
     rr-- red
     gg-- green
     bb -- blue 

     Now to convert decimal to hex just divide decimal value with 16 until result become 0 treat it as an integ division in 
     programming we can use mod operator to find hex values % (mod operator)

     hex values are from 00 to ff same as decimal value (0-255)
    
     Now lets try some of the hex values
     #ff0000 ---- red
     #ffffff ---- white
     #000000 --- black

     Then comes
    hsl : is hue , saturation , lightness
    hue is the degress on the color wheel 0 is red ,120 is green , and 240 is blue
    saturation means the intensity of the color -- the more saturation means pure color and less the saturation means it is going towards gray -- percentage value 0% means a ashades of grey , 100% full color
    lightness --0% -- black and 100% -- white
     hsl(0,0%,0%)
     hsl(0,100%,50%)
